# Torc.Aguilar.BookLibrary

The time limit for this assignment was 3 hours which was enough for me to get the project's back end up and running and almost all of the front end.
I spent another half an hour fixing the front end and finishing up some minor adjustments.
A problem with my front end dependencies which required me to delete my node_modules folder and reinstall the project's node packages was most of the extra time I used to get this project working.
